# ABOUT
A Unity3D game that simulates path finding using various algorithms.

Developed by Philip Michael.


# COMPILATION
This game requires Unity 5 or higher for smooth compilation and run.

Simply open MainScene.unity and press Play if you'd like to test it.

Otherwise, please build it for Desktop. This is not compatible with mobile or tablet platforms.


# USAGE INSTRUCTIONS
The game will load at a default algorithm state.

To change it, please follow the on-screen instructions, i.e.:

- Press '1' to change the pathfinding algorithm to use Dijkstra's.

- Press '2' to change the pathfinding algorithm to use A* with Euclidean Distance heuristic.

- Press '3' to change the pathfinding algorithm to use a Cluster algorithm that uses A* with Euclidean Distance heuristic.

- Press 'T' to change the floor's appearance from the default of showing the cluster zones, to simply the textured flooring.


In order to set a goal node, please click anywhere in the main scene's level and it will find the closest node to your click.
